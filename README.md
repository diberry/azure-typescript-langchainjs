# Azure TypeScript LangChainJS Sample

This sample demonstrates how to build an intelligent agent using TypeScript, [LangChain.js](https://js.langchain.com/), [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraphjs), Azure OpenAI, and Azure AI Search to create a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) application.

The sample includes an HR document query system that allows users to ask questions about employee benefits and company policies, with the agent retrieving relevant information from PDF documents.

## Features

- TypeScript-based LangChain.js implementation
- LangGraph agent architecture for dynamic orchestration of AI components
- Integration with Azure OpenAI for embeddings and completions
- Vector search with Azure AI Search
- FastAPI server for RESTful API access
- Docker support for containerized deployment
- Environment variable management
- PDF document processing and vector storage

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as a monorepo with the following packages:

- **langgraph-agent**: Core agent implementation using LangGraph
- **server-api**: FastAPI server exposing the agent functionality

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-typescript-langchainjs.git
cd azure-typescript-langchainjs
```

### 2. Set up Azure resources

Use Azure Developer CLI to deploy the resources.

```bash
azd auth login
azd up
```

This creates the resources ready to use with passwordless credentials. 


### 3. Configure environment variables

The Azure Developer CLI creates a `.env` file with the necessary environment variables. Add the following optional variables to use LangSmith observability.

```
# Optional LangSmith configuration
LANGSMITH_TRACING=true
LANGSMITH_ENDPOINT="https://api.smith.langchain.com"
LANGSMITH_API_KEY="<your-langsmith-api-key>"
LANGSMITH_PROJECT="<your-langsmith-project-name>"
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Load data into vector store

Build the `server-api` and `langgraph-agent`, then load the `./packages-v1/langgraph-agent/data` into the vector store. 

```bash
npm run build
npm run load_data
```

After the `northwind` index is created, it has 263 documents.

### 6. Run the application

#### Run the API server

```bash
npm run start
```

The server will be available at http://localhost:3000.

#### Run the LangGraph Studio (optional)

```bash
npm run studio
```

This will start the LangGraph Studio interface where you can visualize and debug the agent's workflow.

## Docker Support

You can also run the application in a Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t langchain-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env langchain-app
```

This will build a Docker image and run it, exposing the API server on port 3000.

## API Usage

The API server exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /`: Health check endpoint
- `POST /answer`: Submit a question to the agent

Example request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/answer \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What are the standard benefit options?"}' 
```

## Example Questions

The agent can answer questions about the HR documents, such as:

1. "What are the standard benefit options?"
2. "Tell me about dental coverage in the Health Plus plan"
3. "What does the employee handbook say about vacation time?"
